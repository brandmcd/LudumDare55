  - So Leo saw that?
  - You got me, I did have an argument with my brother before the blackout.
  - "I was telling him how he must stop wasting all his money, but he wouldn\u2019t
    listen to me. "
  - "During mid argument the lights went off. I grabbed his hand so he wouldn\u2019t
    use it as an opportunity to leave! "
  - " I wasn\u2019t done speaking! There was a loud crash too, I think something
    broke."
