  - 'Jeeves, this is most unexpected and deeply troubling. '
  - "To think that you would suspect me, in my own home, of orchestrating the theft
    of my own diamond\u2014it's absurd. "
  - 'I showcased the Star of the Empire out of pride, not folly. Yes, I have my secrets
    and my flaws, but betrayal of my guests and myself? '
  - That is not one of them. I implore you to look deeper, Jeeves. You have missed
    the mark this time
