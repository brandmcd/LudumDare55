  - Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you humbled and apologetic.
  - Despite my best efforts, I have failed to uphold the standards of justice and
    truth that are the bedrock of my duties.
  - 'My accusations have not only been misguided but have caused undue stress and
    harm. '
  - 'As such, it is only proper that I tender my resignation, effective immediately. '
  - 'I deeply regret any turmoil I have caused and hope that my departure will allow
    the healing process to begin. '
  - I have always aimed to serve with integrity, and it is my hope that my mistake
    will not overshadow the many years of faithful service I have dedicated to this
    house.
