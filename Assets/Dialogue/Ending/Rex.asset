  - It appears the game is up.
  - Yes, Jeeves, I took the diamond. My resentment towards Mr. Dactyl for abandoning
    our partnership
  - and flaunting that damn stone tonight of all nights, it was too much.
  - As for my affair with Valorie, well, that was a mistake too, one I regret deeply.
  - You've unraveled everything, but know this was never about greed, but pride.
