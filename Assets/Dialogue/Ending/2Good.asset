  - 'Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, justice has been served within these walls. '
  - 'Mr. Tyer Rex, you have been found guilty of not only the theft of the Star of
    the Empire but also of betraying the trust we all placed in you. '
  - It is with no pleasure that I pronounce your fate.
  - 'You will face the consequences of your actions and will be handed over to the
    authorities. '
  - 'Let this be a reminder to us all that no matter how dark the night, the light
    of truth will always find a way to break through. '
  - 'As for myself, I shall continue to serve this household with the loyalty and
    diligence you have all come to expect. '
